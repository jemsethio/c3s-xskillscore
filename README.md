# Calculating correlation and skill score on C3S seasonal forecasts

The Google Colab notebook shows an example of a workflow involving multiple python modules to calculate on-the-fly (more or less) correlation and probabilistic skill scores on a seasonal forecast downloaded by the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home)
